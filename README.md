### Windows Build
---
To build on Windows install Qt at least version 5.10. The project files 
are Visual Studio 2017 which is the recommended version to use. Also 
install the Qt visual studio add-in which can be found on the Visual 
Studio Marketplace. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the 
usual way. 
### Linux Build
---
To build on Linux be sure to have installed the Qt5 development 
libraries for your distribution as well as developer tools such as 
compiler, build tools, etc. Then run the build.sh script which will 
create a makefile and execute the appropriate targets.
